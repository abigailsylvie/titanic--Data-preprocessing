# 🚢 Titanic Dataset: Data Preprocessing

This repository contains the code and steps for preprocessing the Titanic dataset, a classic dataset used for machine learning practice. The goal is to clean and prepare the data to improve model accuracy.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data) and includes passenger information like age, gender, ticket class, and survival status.

## 🛠️ Preprocessing Steps

1. **Load the Data:**
   - Use `pandas` to load the CSV file into a DataFrame.

2. **Explore the Data:**
   - Check for missing values, data types, and summary statistics.

3. **Handle Missing Values:**
   - Fill missing `Age` with the median.
   - Fill missing `Embarked` with the most common value.
   - Drop `Cabin` due to too many missing entries.

4. **Encode Categorical Variables:**
   - Convert `Sex` and `Embarked` into numerical features using one-hot encoding.

5. **Feature Scaling:**
   - Scale numerical features like `Age` and `Fare` with `StandardScaler`.

6. **Split the Data:**
   - Divide the data into training and test sets using `train_test_split`.

## 🏁 Final Processed Data
The cleaned and preprocessed data is ready for model training!
